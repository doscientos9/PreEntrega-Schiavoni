        <p class="paragraph-style">DUNDER MIFFLIN, Inc. is committed to providing its customers quality office and
            information technology products, furniture, printing values and the experience required for making informed
            buyer decisions.
            We provide our Customers with the highest standard of integrity and quality, to enable them to develop
            long-term professional relationships with our employees and staff.
            We crusade to create a stable working environment and corporate spirit and to give unlimited opportunity to
            women, and to afford ordinary folk the chance to buy the same things as rich people. We are also committed
            to nurturing and promulgating wholesome American values.
            We strive to become the company most known for changing the worldwide poorâ€“quality image of Chinese
            products.
            The company was founded by Robert Dunder and Robert Mifflin in 1949, where they supplied metal brackets.
            Eventually, the company started selling paper and opened several branches across the Northeastern United
            States.
            In 2009, the company went bankrupt, and was bought by printer company Sabre.
            In 2012, Sabre was dissolved and the company became Dunder Mifflin once again.
            With a corporate office in New York City, Dunder Mifflin has branches in Akron, Ohio; Nashua, New Hampshire;
            Rochester, New York; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Syracuse, New York; and Utica, New York.
            For years, Dunder Mifflin was a paper company that was unable to compete with modern chains such as Staples
            and Office Depot.
            The company still used calls rather than the Internet, causing most customers to leave for the nation-wide
            chains, and is unable to adapt to an increasingly paperless world.
            Ryan Howard, a new employee of the Scranton branch, predicts the company will be obsolete by 2017. In 2007,
            Ryan Howard became Vice President of Sales and begins a massive restructuring of the entire company,
            including a new website that would help make sales more efficient.
            However, his website was a failure (due to an ill-advised social networking feature) and he is later
            arrested for fraud when it is discovered that he is double-counting sales transactions into the website that
            were already made by salesmen over the phone.
